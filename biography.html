			Albert Einstein was born in Ulm,[15] in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the
			German Empire, on 14 March 1879. His parents, secular Ashkenazi Jews, were
			Hermann Einstein, a salesman and engineer, and Pauline Koch. In 1880, the

			his lifelong fascination with electromagnetism. He realized that
			"Something deeply hidden had to be behind things."[16] Albert attended St.
			Peter's Catholic elementary school in Munich from the age of five. When he
			was eight, he was transferred to the Luitpold Gymnasium, where he received
			advanced primary and then secondary school education.[17] Einstein's
			parents, Hermann and Pauline In 1894, Hermann and Jakob's company tendered
			for a contract to install electric lighting in Munich, but without
			success—they lacked the capital that would have been required to update
			their technology from direct current to the more efficient, alternating
			current alternative.[18] The failure of their bid forced them to sell
			their Munich factory and search for new opportunities elsewhere. The
			Einstein family moved to Italy, first to Milan and a few months later to
			Pavia, where they settled in Palazzo Cornazzani.[19] Einstein, then
			fifteen, stayed behind in Munich in order to finish his schooling. His
			father wanted him to study electrical engineering, but he was a fractious
			pupil who found the Gymnasium's regimen and teaching methods far from
			congenial. He later wrote that the school's policy of strict rote learning
			was harmful to creativity. At the end of December 1894, a letter from a
			doctor persuaded the Luitpold's authorities to release him from its care,
			and he joined his family in Pavia.[20] While in Italy as a teenager, he
			wrote an essay entitled "On the Investigation of the State of the Ether in
			a Magnetic Field".[21][22] Einstein excelled at physics and mathematics
			from an early age, and soon acquired the mathematical expertise normally
			only found in a child several years his senior. He began teaching himself
			algebra, calculus and Euclidean geometry when he was twelve; he made such
			rapid progress that he discovered an original proof of the Pythagorean
			theorem before his thirteenth birthday.[23][24] A family tutor, Max
			Talmud, said that only a short time after he had given the twelve year old
			Einstein a geometry textbook, the boy had worked through the whole book.
			He thereupon devoted himself to higher mathematics ... Soon the flight of
			his mathematical genius was so high I could not follow.[25] Einstein
			recorded that he had "mastered integral and differential calculus" while
			still just fourteen.[26] His love of algebra and geometry was so great
			that at twelve, he was already confident that nature could be understood
			as a "mathematical structure".[25] Studio photo of a boy seated in a
			relaxed posture and wearing a suit, posed in front of a backdrop of

			enthusiasms had broadened to include music and philosophy,[27] Talmud
			introduced Einstein to Kant's Critique of Pure Reason. Kant became his
			favorite philosopher; according to Talmud, At the time he was still a
			child, only thirteen years old, yet Kant's works, incomprehensible to
			ordinary mortals, seemed to be clear to him.[25] In 1895, at the age of
			sixteen, Einstein sat the entrance examination for the federal polytechnic
			school (later the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, ETH) in Zurich,
			Switzerland. He failed to reach the required standard in the general part
			of the test,[28] but performed with distinction in physics and
			mathematics.[29] On the advice of the polytechnic's principal, he
			completed his secondary education at the Argovian cantonal school (a
			gymnasium) in Aarau, Switzerland, graduating in 1896.[30] While lodging in
			Aarau with the family of Jost Winteler, he fell in love with Winteler's
			daughter, Marie. (His sister, Maja, later married Winteler's son
			Paul.[31]) Einstein's matriculation certificate at the age of 17. The
			heading translates as "The Education Committee of the Canton of Aargau".
			His scores were German 5, French 3, Italian 5, History 6, Geography 4,
			Algebra 6, Geometry 6, Descriptive Geometry 6, Physics 6, Chemistry 5,
			Natural History 5, Art Drawing 4, Technical Drawing 4. 6 = very good, 5 =
			good, 4 = sufficient, 3 = insufficient, 2 = poor, 1 = very poor.
			Einstein's Matura certificate from canton Aargau, 1896[note 2] In January
			1896, with his father's approval, Einstein renounced his citizenship of
			the German Kingdom of Württemberg in order to avoid conscription into
			military service.[32] The Matura (graduation for the successful completion
			of higher secondary schooling), awarded to him in September 1896,
			acknowledged him to have performed well across most of the curriculum,
			allotting him a top grade of 6 for history, physics, algebra, geometry,
			and descriptive geometry.[33] At seventeen, he enrolled in the four-year
			mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the federal
			polytechnic school. Marie Winteler, a year older than him, took up a
			teaching post in Olsberg, Switzerland.[31] The five other polytechnic
			school freshmen following the same course as Einstein included just one
			woman, a twenty year old Serbian, Mileva Marić. Over the next few years,
			the pair spent many hours discussing their shared interests and learning
			about topics in physics that the polytechnic school's lectures did not
			cover. In his letters to Marić, Einstein confessed that exploring science
			with her by his side was much more enjoyable than reading a textbook in
			solitude. Eventually the two students became not only friends but also
			lovers.[34] Historians of physics are divided on the question of the
			extent to which Marić contributed to the insights of Einstein's annus
			mirabilis publications. There is at least some evidence that he was
			influenced by her scientific ideas,[34][35][36] but there are scholars who
			doubt whether her impact on his thought was of any great significance at
			all.[37][38][39][40] Marriages, relationships and children Albert Einstein
			and Mileva Marić Einstein, 1912 Correspondence between Einstein and Marić,
			discovered and published in 1987, revealed that in early 1902, while Marić
			was visiting her parents in Novi Sad, she gave birth to a daughter,
			Lieserl. When Marić returned to Switzerland it was without the child,
			whose fate is uncertain. A letter of Einstein's that he wrote in September
			1903 suggests that the girl was either given up for adoption or died of
			scarlet fever in infancy.[41][42] Einstein and Marić married in January
			1903. In May 1904, their son Hans Albert was born in Bern, Switzerland.
			Their son Eduard was born in Zurich in July 1910. In letters that Einstein
			wrote to Marie Winteler in the months before Eduard's arrival, he
			described his love for his wife as "misguided" and mourned the "missed
			life" that he imagined he would have enjoyed if he had married Winteler
			instead: "I think of you in heartfelt love every spare minute and am so
			unhappy as only a man can be."[43] Einstein, looking relaxed and holding a
			pipe, stands next to a smiling, well-dressed Elsa who is wearing a fancy
			hat and fur wrap. She is looking at him. Albert and Elsa Einstein arriving
			in New York, 1921 In 1912, Einstein entered into a relationship with Elsa
			Löwenthal, who was both his first cousin on his mother's side and his
			second cousin on his father's.[44][45][46] When Marić learned of his
			infidelity soon after moving to Berlin with him in April 1914, she
			returned to Zurich, taking Hans Albert and Eduard with her.[34] Einstein
			and Marić were granted a divorce on 14 February 1919 on the grounds of
			having lived apart for five years.[47][48] As part of the divorce
			settlement, Einstein agreed that if he were to win a Nobel Prize, he would
			give the money that he received to Marić; he won the prize two years
			later.[49] Einstein married Löwenthal in 1919.[50][51] In 1923, he began a
			relationship with a secretary named Betty Neumann, the niece of his close
			friend Hans Mühsam.[52][53][54][55] Löwenthal nevertheless remained loyal
			to him, accompanying him when he emigrated to the United States in 1933.
			In 1935, she was diagnosed with heart and kidney problems. She died in
			December 1936.[56] Albert and Elsa Einstein, 1930 A volume of Einstein's
			letters released by Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 2006[57] added some
			other women with whom he was romantically involved. They included
			Margarete Lebach (a married Austrian),[58] Estella Katzenellenbogen (the
			rich owner of a florist business), Toni Mendel (a wealthy Jewish widow)
			and Ethel Michanowski (a Berlin socialite), with whom he spent time and
			from whom he accepted gifts while married to Löwenthal.[59][60] After
			being widowed, Einstein was briefly in a relationship with Margarita
			Konenkova, thought by some to be a Russian spy; her husband, the Russian
			sculptor Sergei Konenkov, created the bronze bust of Einstein at the
			Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton.[61][62] Following an episode of
			acute mental illness at about the age of twenty, Einstein's son Eduard was
			diagnosed with schizophrenia.[63] He spent the remainder of his life
			either in the care of his mother or in temporary confinement in an asylum.
			After her death, he was committed permanently to Burghölzli, the
			Psychiatric University Hospital in Zurich.[64] 1902–1909: Assistant at the

			mathematics and physics.[65] His successful acquisition of Swiss
			citizenship in February 1901[66] was not followed by the usual sequel of
			conscription; the Swiss authorities deemed him medically unfit for
			military service. He found that Swiss schools too appeared to have no use
			for him, failing to offer him a teaching position despite the almost two
			years that he spent applying for one. Eventually it was with the help of
			Marcel Grossmann's father that he secured a post in Bern at the Swiss
			Patent Office,[67][68] as an assistant examiner – level III.[69][70]
			Patent applications that landed on Einstein's desk for his evaluation
			included ideas for a gravel sorter and an electric typewriter.[70] His
			employers were pleased enough with his work to make his position permanent
			in 1903, although they did not think that he should be promoted until he
			had "fully mastered machine technology".[71] It is conceivable that his
			labors at the patent office had a bearing on his development of his
			special theory of relativity. He arrived at his revolutionary ideas about
			space, time and light through thought experiments about the transmission
			of signals and the synchronization of clocks, matters which also figured
			in some of the inventions submitted to him for assessment.[10] In 1902,
			Einstein and some friends whom he had met in Bern formed a group that held
			regular meetings to discuss science and philosophy. Their choice of a name
			for their club, the Olympia Academy, was an ironic comment upon its far
			from Olympian status. Sometimes they were joined by Marić, who limited her
			participation in their proceedings to careful listening.[72] The thinkers
			whose works they reflected upon included Henri Poincaré, Ernst Mach and
			David Hume, all of whom significantly influenced Einstein's own subsequent
			ideas and beliefs.[73] 1900–1905: First scientific papers Cover image of

			neue Be­stimm­ung der Mol­e­kül­di­men­si­one ("A new deter­mi­na­tion of

			Capillaritätserscheinungen" ("Conclusions drawn from the phenomena of
			capillarity"), in which he proposed a model of intermolecular attraction
			that he afterwards disavowed as worthless, was published in the journal
			Annalen der Physik in 1901.[74][75] His 24-page doctoral dissertation also
			addressed a topic in molecular physics. Titled "Eine neue Bestimmung der
			Moleküldimensionen" ("A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions") and
			dedicated to his friend Marcel Grossman, it was completed on 30 April
			1905[76] and approved by Professor Alfred Kleiner of the University of
			Zurich three months later. (Einstein was formally awarded his PhD on 15
			January 1906.)[76][77][78] Four other pieces of work that Einstein
			completed in 1905—his famous papers on the photoelectric effect, Brownian
			motion, his special theory of relativity and the equivalence of mass and
			energy—have led to the year being celebrated as an annus mirabilis for
			physics akin to 1666 (the year in which Isaac Newton experienced his
			greatest epiphanies). The publications deeply impressed Einstein's
			contemporaries.[79] 1908–1933: Academic career in Europe Einstein's
			sabbatical as a civil servant approached its end in 1908, when he secured
			a junior teaching position at the University of Bern. In 1909, a lecture
			on relativistic electrodynamics that he gave at the University of Zurich,
			much admired by Alfred Kleiner, led to Zurich's luring him away from Bern
			with a newly created associate professorship.[80] Promotion to a full
			professorship followed in April 1911, when he accepted a chair at the
			German Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague, a move which required him
			to become an Austrian citizen of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which was
			not completed.[citation needed] His time in Prague saw him producing
			eleven research papers.[81] Einstein with colleagues at the ETH in Zurich,
			1913 In July 1912, he returned to his alma mater, the ETH Zurich, to take
			up a chair in theoretical physics. His teaching activities there centered
			on thermodynamics and analytical mechanics, and his research interests
			included the molecular theory of heat, continuum mechanics and the
			development of a relativistic theory of gravitation. In his work on the
			latter topic, he was assisted by his friend Marcel Grossmann, whose
			knowledge of the kind of mathematics required was greater than his
			own.[82] In the spring of 1913, two German visitors, Max Planck and
			Walther Nernst, called upon Einstein in Zurich in the hope of persuading
			him to relocate to Berlin.[83] They offered him membership of the Prussian
			Academy of Sciences, the directorship of the planned Kaiser Wilhelm
			Institute for Physics and a chair at the Humboldt University of Berlin
			that would allow him to pursue his research supported by a professorial
			salary but with no teaching duties to burden him.[45] Their invitation was
			all the more appealing to him because Berlin happened to be the home of
			his latest girlfriend, Elsa Löwenthal.[83] He duly joined the Academy on
			24 July 1913,[84] and moved into an apartment in the Berlin district of
			Dahlem on 1 April 1914.[45] He was installed in his Humboldt University
			position shortly thereafter.[84] Einstein with other physicists and

			Theory of critical opalescence Main article: Critical opalescence Einstein
			returned to the problem of thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment
			of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point. Ordinarily the
			density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free
			energy with respect to the density. At the critical point, this derivative
			is zero, leading to large fluctuations. The effect of density fluctuations
			is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky
			white. Einstein relates this to Rayleigh scattering, which is what happens
			when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and which
			explains why the sky is blue.[218] Einstein quantitatively derived
			critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations, and
			demonstrated how both the effect and Rayleigh scattering originate from
			the atomistic constitution of matter. 1905 – Annus Mirabilis papers The
			Annus Mirabilis papers are four articles pertaining to the photoelectric
			effect (which gave rise to quantum theory), Brownian motion, the special
			theory of relativity, and E = mc2 that Einstein published in the Annalen
			der Physik scientific journal in 1905. These four works contributed
			substantially to the foundation of modern physics and changed views on
			space, time, and matter. The four papers are: Title (translated) Area of

			the Production and Transformation of Light"[219] Photoelectric effect 18
			March 9 June Resolved an unsolved puzzle by suggesting that energy is
			exchanged only in discrete amounts (quanta).[220] This idea was pivotal to

			("On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies") was received on 30 June 1905
			and published 26 September of that same year. It reconciled conflicts
			between Maxwell's equations (the laws of electricity and magnetism) and
			the laws of Newtonian mechanics by introducing changes to the laws of
			mechanics.[227] Observationally, the effects of these changes are most
			apparent at high speeds (where objects are moving at speeds close to the
			speed of light). The theory developed in this paper later became known as
			Einstein's special theory of relativity. This paper predicted that, when
			measured in the frame of a relatively moving observer, a clock carried by
			a moving body would appear to slow down, and the body itself would
			contract in its direction of motion. This paper also argued that the idea
			of a luminiferous aether—one of the leading theoretical entities in
			physics at the time—was superfluous.[note 4] In his paper on mass–energy
			equivalence, Einstein produced E = mc2 as a consequence of his special
			relativity equations.[228] Einstein's 1905 work on relativity remained
			controversial for many years, but was accepted by leading physicists,
			starting with Max Planck.[note 5][229] Einstein originally framed special
			relativity in terms of kinematics (the study of moving bodies). In 1908,
			Hermann Minkowski reinterpreted special relativity in geometric terms as a
			theory of spacetime. Einstein adopted Minkowski's formalism in his 1915
			general theory of relativity.[230] General relativity General relativity

			was developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1915. According to it, the
			observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping
			of spacetime by those masses. General relativity has developed into an
			essential tool in modern astrophysics; it provides the foundation for the
			current understanding of black holes, regions of space where gravitational
			attraction is so strong that not even light can escape.[231] As Einstein
			later said, the reason for the development of general relativity was that
			the preference of inertial motions within special relativity was
			unsatisfactory, while a theory which from the outset prefers no state of
			motion (even accelerated ones) should appear more satisfactory.[232]
			Consequently, in 1907 he published an article on acceleration under
			special relativity. In that article titled "On the Relativity Principle
			and the Conclusions Drawn from It", he argued that free fall is really
			inertial motion, and that for a free-falling observer the rules of special
			relativity must apply. This argument is called the equivalence principle.
			In the same article, Einstein also predicted the phenomena of
			gravitational time dilation, gravitational redshift and gravitational
			lensing.[233][234] In 1911, Einstein published another article "On the
			Influence of Gravitation on the Propagation of Light" expanding on the
			1907 article, in which he estimated the amount of deflection of light by
			massive bodies. Thus, the theoretical prediction of general relativity
			could for the first time be tested experimentally.[235] Gravitational
			waves In 1916, Einstein predicted gravitational waves,[236][237] ripples
			in the curvature of spacetime which propagate as waves, traveling outward
			from the source, transporting energy as gravitational radiation. The
			existence of gravitational waves is possible under general relativity due
			to its Lorentz invariance which brings the concept of a finite speed of
			propagation of the physical interactions of gravity with it. By contrast,
			gravitational waves cannot exist in the Newtonian theory of gravitation,
			which postulates that the physical interactions of gravity propagate at
			infinite speed. The first, indirect, detection of gravitational waves came
			in the 1970s through observation of a pair of closely orbiting neutron
			stars, PSR B1913+16.[238] The explanation for the decay in their orbital
			period was that they were emitting gravitational waves.[238][239]
			Einstein's prediction was confirmed on 11 February 2016, when researchers
			at LIGO published the first observation of gravitational waves,[240]
			detected on Earth on 14 September 2015, nearly one hundred years after the
			prediction.[238][241][242][243][244] Hole argument and Entwurf theory
			While developing general relativity, Einstein became confused about the
			gauge invariance in the theory. He formulated an argument that led him to
			conclude that a general relativistic field theory is impossible. He gave
			up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations and searched for
			equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations
			only.[245] In June 1913, the Entwurf ('draft') theory was the result of
			these investigations. As its name suggests, it was a sketch of a theory,
			less elegant and more difficult than general relativity, with the
			equations of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions.
			After more than two years of intensive work, Einstein realized that the
			hole argument was mistaken[246] and abandoned the theory in November 1915.
			Physical cosmology Main article: Physical cosmology Robert A. Millikan,
			Georges Lemaître and Einstein at the California Institute of Technology in
			January 1933 In 1917, Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to
			the structure of the universe as a whole.[247] He discovered that the
			general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic, either
			contracting or expanding. As observational evidence for a dynamic universe
			was lacking at the time, Einstein introduced a new term, the cosmological
			constant, into the field equations, in order to allow the theory to
			predict a static universe. The modified field equations predicted a static
			universe of closed curvature, in accordance with Einstein's understanding
			of Mach's principle in these years. This model became known as the
			Einstein World or Einstein's static universe.[248][249] Following the
			discovery of the recession of the galaxies by Edwin Hubble in 1929,
			Einstein abandoned his static model of the universe, and proposed two
			dynamic models of the cosmos, the Friedmann–Einstein universe of
			1931[250][251] and the Einstein–de Sitter universe of 1932.[252][253] In
			each of these models, Einstein discarded the cosmological constant,
			claiming that it was "in any case theoretically
			unsatisfactory".[250][251][254] In many Einstein biographies, it is
			claimed that Einstein referred to the cosmological constant in later years
			as his "biggest blunder", based on a letter George Gamow claimed to have
			received from him. The astrophysicist Mario Livio has cast doubt on this
			claim.[255] In late 2013, a team led by the Irish physicist Cormac
			O'Raifeartaigh discovered evidence that, shortly after learning of
			Hubble's observations of the recession of the galaxies, Einstein
			considered a steady-state model of the universe.[256][257] In a hitherto
			overlooked manuscript, apparently written in early 1931, Einstein explored
			a model of the expanding universe in which the density of matter remains
			constant due to a continuous creation of matter, a process that he
			associated with the cosmological constant.[258][259] As he stated in the
			paper, In what follows, I would like to draw attention to a solution to
			equation (1) that can account for Hubbel's [sic] facts, and in which the
			density is constant over time [...] If one considers a physically bounded
			volume, particles of matter will be continually leaving it. For the
			density to remain constant, new particles of matter must be continually
			formed in the volume from space. It thus appears that Einstein considered
			a steady-state model of the expanding universe many years before Hoyle,
			Bondi and Gold.[260][261] However, Einstein's steady-state model contained
			a fundamental flaw and he quickly abandoned the idea.[258][259][262]
			Energy momentum pseudotensor Main article: Stress–energy–momentum
			pseudotensor General relativity includes a dynamical spacetime, so it is
			difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and momentum.
			Noether's theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a
			Lagrangian with translation invariance, but general covariance makes
			translation invariance into something of a gauge symmetry. The energy and
			momentum derived within general relativity by Noether's prescriptions do
			not make a real tensor for this reason.[263] Einstein argued that this is
			true for a fundamental reason: the gravitational field could be made to
			vanish by a choice of coordinates. He maintained that the non-covariant
			energy momentum pseudotensor was, in fact, the best description of the
			energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field. While the use of
			non-covariant objects like pseudotensors was criticized by Erwin
			Schrödinger and others, Einstein's approach has been echoed by physicists
			including Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz.[264] Wormholes In 1935, Einstein
			collaborated with Nathan Rosen to produce a model of a wormhole, often
			called Einstein–Rosen bridges.[265][266] His motivation was to model
			elementary particles with charge as a solution of gravitational field
			equations, in line with the program outlined in the paper "Do
			Gravitational Fields play an Important Role in the Constitution of the
			Elementary Particles?". These solutions cut and pasted Schwarzschild black
			holes to make a bridge between two patches. Because these solutions
			included spacetime curvature without the presence of a physical body,
			Einstein and Rosen suggested that they could provide the beginnings of a
			theory that avoided the notion of point particles. However, it was later
			found that Einstein–Rosen bridges are not stable.[267] Einstein–Cartan
			theory Main article: Einstein–Cartan theory Einstein, sitting at a table,
			looks up from the papers he is reading and into the camera. Einstein at
			his office, University of Berlin, 1920 In order to incorporate spinning
			point particles into general relativity, the affine connection needed to
			be generalized to include an antisymmetric part, called the torsion. This
			modification was made by Einstein and Cartan in the 1920s. Equations of
			motion Main article: Einstein–Infeld–Hoffmann equations In general
			relativity, gravitational force is reimagined as curvature of spacetime. A
			curved path like an orbit is not the result of a force deflecting a body
			from an ideal straight-line path, but rather the body's attempt to fall
			freely through a background that is itself curved by the presence of other
			masses. A remark by John Archibald Wheeler that has become proverbial
			among physicists summarizes the theory: Spacetime tells matter how to
			move; matter tells spacetime how to curve.[268][269] The Einstein field
			equations cover the latter aspect of the theory, relating the curvature of
			spacetime to the distribution of matter and energy. The geodesic equation
			covers the former aspect, stating that freely falling bodies follow lines
			that are as straight as possible in a curved spacetime. Einstein regarded
			this as an "independent fundamental assumption" that had to be postulated
			in addition to the field equations in order to complete the theory.
			Believing this to be a shortcoming in how general relativity was
			originally presented, he wished to derive it from the field equations
			themselves. Since the equations of general relativity are non-linear, a
			lump of energy made out of pure gravitational fields, like a black hole,
			would move on a trajectory which is determined by the Einstein field
			equations themselves, not by a new law. Accordingly, Einstein proposed
			that the field equations would determine the path of a singular solution,
			like a black hole, to be a geodesic. Both physicists and philosophers have
			often repeated the assertion that the geodesic equation can be obtained
			from applying the field equations to the motion of a gravitational
			singularity, but this claim remains disputed.[270][271] Old quantum theory
			Main article: Old quantum theory Photons and energy quanta The
			photoelectric effect. Incoming photons on the left strike a metal plate
			(bottom), and eject electrons, depicted as flying off to the right. In a
			1905 paper,[219] Einstein postulated that light itself consists of
			localized particles (quanta). Einstein's light quanta were nearly
			universally rejected by all physicists, including Max Planck and Niels
			Bohr. This idea only became universally accepted in 1919, with Robert
			Millikan's
